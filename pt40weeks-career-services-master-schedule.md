While it’s vital to learn how to code if you want to be a software developer, finding your first job can be a challenge. Over the years, we’ve identified processes and behaviors that tend to make the difference between a graduate being successful or not. To this end, alongside the coding curriculum you’ll be going through during the program, there is also a career services curriculum. The same expectations and deadlines will apply to both types of assignments.
Your advisor will send out an email with the specific dates when different pieces of the career services curriculum will occur, but here is a broad overview of what you can expect.

**Week 2: SMART Goal Setting and Career Exploration** This week, you’ll set some initial goals for your time at Epicodus and career in tech. You’ll also start to explore the opportunities and options for a career in tech by looking at real job boards and real positions in the industry. 

**Week 3: Identifying Important Skills, Strengths, and Weaknesses**  This week, you will spend time identifying your skills, strengths, and weaknesses, and how they align with the skills that are most relevant to the tech industry.
